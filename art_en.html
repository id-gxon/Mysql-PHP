            View of the Sea at Scheveningen is the second painting drawn under
            the guidance of Anton Mobe. Gogh built an easel on the desolate
            field of the beach and painted the sea view on the canvas at high
            speed on the beach amid the sand breeze. The bold composition
            method, which uses a large horizontal space to outline sand,
            seawater, and dark skies, is in good harmony with the use of thick
            and expressive paints. Through the realistic expression of the beach
            scene, it can be seen that Gogh is well aware of contemporary
            impressionism. Gogh painted while fighting the fluttering sand and
            the wind sticking to wet paint, most of which were removed from the
            painting, but several particles still remain between some of the
            paints.

          <p>
            The Potato Eaters is considered one of Gogh's masterpieces. Gogh,
            who saw the lives of farmers sowing seeds and living diligently in
            Nunen, Netherlands, and vowed to live hard like farmers, painted a
            picture of five earthy people eating potatoes in a dark room with
            dim lights on oil lamps, describing the tough reality of rural life.
            The rough face, large, knotted hands, and dusty potatoes show that
            he will go his way as a painter. However, although the painting was
            criticized for being dark and the characters were full of errors, it
            was the best painting by Gogh himself.

            Self-Portrait with Gray Felt Hat is the first representative work to
            welcome the audience at the entrance of the Van Gogh Museum in
            Amsterdam. The dynamic brush strokes, a feast of primary colors
            shining like starlight, and the contrast between a skinny face and
            colorful colors express Van Gogh's agonizing inner side more
            intensely. Overall, very bright paints were used a lot, and the
            face, an important part of the self-portrait, was mixed with white,
            pink, and yellow, and occasionally green to make it look very
            colorful. In 1978, a visitor tore this work into an X-shape with a
            knife, and fortunately, it was restored well, so you can't see it
            from the front, but if you look up from the bottom, you can see the
            X-shape.

            The cafe terrace at night is the first work Van Gogh completed
            during his stay in Arles, France, and is a painting of the night
            view of an outdoor cafe located in Arles' Forroom Square. When
            describing houses and intense colors of dark blue and bright yellow,
            such as coloring the cafe's shade with yellow, which is close to
            lemon, it is not bound by perspective and exaggerates its shape to
            reveal the passionate inner world.
