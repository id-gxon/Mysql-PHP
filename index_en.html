        <p>Vincent van Gogh</p>
        <p>
          Vincent Willem van Gogh(30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
          Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
          famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he
          created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most
          of which date from the last two years of his life. They include
          landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are
          characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
          brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not
          commercially successful, he struggled with severe depression and
          poverty, eventually leading to his suicide at age thirty-seven. Van
          Gogh was considered a madman and failure throughout his life. He, who
          only became famous after suicide, was seen as a misunderstood genius
          in the public's imagination, and his reputation grew in the early 20th
          century when elements of his style were integrated by the Beast and
          German expressionists. Today, his legacy is celebrated in his name by
          the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which houses the world's largest
          collection of his paintings and paintings.
